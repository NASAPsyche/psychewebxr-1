What gives asteroid Psyche great scientific interest is that it is likely rich in metal. It may consist largely of metal from the core of an early planet, one of the building blocks of the Sun’s planetary system. At NASA, scientists will explore, for the first time ever, a world made not of rock or ice, but of metal. Dimensions: 173 x 144 x 117 mi (279 x 232 x 189 km) Density: Estimated 3,400 to 4,100 kg/m³ Diameter: 140 mi (226 km) if shown as a perfect sphere Surface Area: 246,300 mi² (641,800 km²)";

That’s 2.5 to 3.3 Astronomical Units (AU), with 1 AU being the distance between Earth and the Sun. Psyche takes about five Earth years to complete one orbit of the Sun, but only a bit over four hours to rotate once on its axis (a Psyche “day”).";
export const MESSAGE_8 = "Observations indicate, Unlike most other asteroids that are rocky or icy bodies, Psyche seems to have a surface that is 90% metallic and 10% silicate rock, with 6±1% orthopyroxene. Scientists think that these metals may be mostly iron and nickel similar to Earth’s core.  ";
export const MESSAGE_9 = "The asteroid is most likely a survivor of multiple violent hit-and-run collisions, common when the solar system was forming. Thus, scientists wonder whether Psyche could be an exposed core of an early planet, maybe as large as Mars, that lost its rocky outer layers due to a number of violent collisions billions of years ago. Psyche may be able to tell us how Earth’s core and the cores of the other terrestrial planets came to be.";
